					Najedzeni Fest is a popular food festival in Krakow, Poland. Together with a couple friends we wanted to give the visitors a chance to connect with vendors beyond the current festival experience. The idea of a proximity-aware mobile app was born.

					Bluetooth-based proximity sensing is far from perfect in huge crowds. We needed to test how it's going to behave to know what interactions we can get away with.
					<br><br>
					Together with an Android developer friend of mine, we quickly created a web container that a javascript function every second with parameters of the beacons. This allowed me to prototype the app using html, css and javascript to handle beacon proximity events.

					I mocked up a html/css version of the app and wrote the javascript that mocked basic functions of the app and showed relevant information when users were near specific beacons. This way, we could launch and iterate on the “fake” html/css app, actually seeing how it reacts to real-world situations.

					Multiple iterations on a living product helped shape the final design. Users could browse all vendors within the app, but only get the "extras" if they were near the booth.

					It was helpful to add a map of the venue — getting to your favorite food faster is always a bonus.

					The app was made with a particular event in mind. Since the main screen of the app was proximity-based, we had to consider errors and use cases from outside the event, as well as the experience before or after the festival.

					We were able to create the iPhone app on deadline. To promote it, we&nbsp;created stickers, posters and a simple landing page.

					Designing for the real world is a slightly different beast than just moving pixels on the screen, and I certainly learned a lot during this project.
					<br><br>
					Prototyping the app using javascript functions based on beacons proximity was especially rewarding, and I spoke about the experience on&nbsp;the 4Developers conference.
