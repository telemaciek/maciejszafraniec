					Najedzeni Fest is a popular food festival in Krakow, Poland. Together with a couple friends we wanted to give its visitors something extra: a chance to connect with vendors beyond the festival experience.

					We wanted to create a proximity-aware mobile app. Customers could collect extra discounts and recipes next to each visited booth. Something of value that would stick around after the food is finished.
					<br><br>
					We quickly learned that bluetooth proximity sensing is far from perfect in&nbsp;huge crowds. We&nbsp;had to test how our app is going to work in real life.

					To start prototyping as early as possible, I came up with an idea to create a simple app that ran recurring javascript function with beacon data.
					<br><br>
					It was hacky, but it allowed me to start testing different solutions and setups using html, css and javascript.
				</p>

				<p>
					During a different event in the same space, we created scenarios to test our ideas. We showed the app to people and observed how they use it.

					After a couple iterations, we were happy with the functionality and flow. I&nbsp;switched back into Photoshop to create icons and hone the final design.
					<br><br>
					Multiple iterations helped shape the final design. Users could browse all&nbsp;vendors, see nearby booths, and view popular meals.

					With crowds and spotty signage, a lot of users asked for a map of the venue.
					Getting to your favorite food faster is always a bonus.
					<br><br>
					Exhibitors that decided to provide customers with extra discounts or recipes were bumped to the top of the list.

					Our app was made with a specific event in mind. But that didn't mean we didn't have to consider the experience before or after the festival.
					<br><br>
					Since the main screen of the app was proximity-based, we had to design for connectivity errors and use cases from outside of the event.

					The app was ready, and Najedzeni Fest was approaching fast. We&nbsp;created posters, stickers and a simple landing page to promote our app.
				</p>

					It was extremely rewarding to watch people use our app during the event, and I certainly learned a lot during this project.
					<br><br>
					Quickly prototyping the app using beacons and javascript was especially cool, and I <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/szafraniec/hammer-nail-tools-in-the-life-of-a-designer">spoke about it</a> on&nbsp;the 4Developers conference.
