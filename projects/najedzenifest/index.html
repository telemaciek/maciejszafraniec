					Najedzeni Fest is a popular food festival in Krakow, Poland. Together with a couple friends we wanted to give its visitors a chance to connect with exhibiting vendors beyond the current festival experience.

					The idea of a proximity-aware mobile app was born. Customers could collect extra discounts and recipes next to each visited booth.
					<br><br>
					But bluetooth proximity sensing is far from perfect in huge crowds. We&nbsp;had to test how our app is going to behave in real situations.

					To start prototyping as early as possible, we created an Android app that ran a special javascript function, with beacon information, every second.

					<br>
					<br>
					It was hacky, but it allowed me to start testing different solutions and setups using html, css and javascript.
				</p>

					This way we could iterate on the html/css version of the app before building the actual thing.
					<br><br>
					During a different event, we created mock scenarios and showed the app to people to see how they would use the app in the real world.

					Multiple iterations helped shape the final design. Users could browse all&nbsp;vendors, see nearby booths, and view popular meals.
					<br><br>
					The exhibitors who decided to provide customers with extra discounts or recipes were bumped to the top of the list.

					With crowds and spotty signage, a lot of users asked for a map of the venue.
					Getting to your favorite food faster is always a bonus.

					Although the app was made with a specific event in mind, we considered the experience before and after the festival.
					<br><br>
					Since the main screen of the app was proximity-based, we had to specially design for errors and use from outside of the event.

					The app was ready, and Najedzeni Fest was approaching fast. We&nbsp;created posters, stickers and a simple landing page to promote our app.

					Designing for the real world is a slightly different beast than just moving pixels on the screen, and I certainly learned a lot during this project.
					<br><br>
					Quickly prototyping the app using beacons and javascript was especially rewarding, and I spoke about it on&nbsp;the 4Developers conference.
