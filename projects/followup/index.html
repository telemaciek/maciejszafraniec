					FollowUp is a suite of tools centred around Gmail, aimed at helping users manage business relationships. As a <strong>senior product designer</strong> slash product manager, I helped remake and grow FollowUp from a simple productivity app to a feature-rich personal CRM.

					Over the course of my work with FollowUp, I was involved in practically every aspect of its business. This included <strong>managing the roadmap</strong>, <strong>data analysis</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, <strong>wireframing</strong>, <strong>UI design</strong> and acting as team leader in absence of CTO.

					Building The Product
				</h2>
				<p>
					During my tenure, I led the effort to <strong>build many major features</strong>, including Contacts Tab, Auto Follow-ups, Link Tracking, Website reminders, and others. Just as importantly, we <strong>removed multiple obsolete features</strong>.

				<p>
					We defined our success metrics as improving <strong>engagement</strong>, increasing <strong>conversion</strong> and <strong>decreasing churn</strong>. We had to play catch–up with our competition while making sure we cater to the existing user base.

				<h2>
					Redesign
				</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>I redesigned the existing application</strong> to be more user-friendly and make room for upcoming features. FollowUp lives in Gmail, so our own style guide had to feel as close to the native environment as possible. Eventually, we decided to adapt Google's <strong>material design</strong> guidelines.

				<p>
					When designing, I used <strong>pen &amp; paper</strong> to quickly visualise a lot of design options before moving on to drawing the most promising UI ideas in <strong>Sketch</strong>. Whenever possible, I created <strong>clickable flows using Marvel</strong> to make sure everything “clicks” from the user’s perspective.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-text">
				<h2>
					Website
				</h2>
				<p>
					Similar to <strong>modelling user journeys</strong> before designing new features, when designing websites, I always tried to start with a well–structured content document. This <strong>content–first design</strong> forced us to make sure the website reads and scans well, and has all the necessary sections.
				</p>

			<div class="project-image">
				<img src="content-first.jpg" alt="PDF with content (left) and finished page, after many changes">
			</div>
			<div class="project-text">
				<p>
					Changes were made on <strong>almost every page of the website</strong>, and on many pages in the web app. The website is usually the first interaction with the product, but the experience doesn’t end on the home page.
					<br>
					<br>
					To increase app “stickiness”, we experimented with different ways to <strong>onboard customers</strong>. I designed a new <strong>contextual tutorial</strong>, and made improvements to almost all stages of the funnel.

				<h2>
					Data–driven Approach
				</h2>
				<p>
					In addition to talking to actual customers, I <strong>leaned heavily on usage data</strong> when improving existing designs. And if some particular information wasn’t available – that just meant we had to figure out a way to get it. Tools like Mixpanel, Intercom, Google Analytics and Hotjar made it easy for me to start gathering and analyze the necessary metrics.

					I was in charge of thinking up and scheduling <strong>regular A/B tests</strong>. We regularly tested something new: from copy and button placements, to complete redesigns of specific pages. Before launching the new website we ran a series of A/B tests to find the most effective messaging.

				<h2>
					Lesson in running a business
				</h2>
				<p>
					Despite little to none advertising spending, FollowUp managed to maintain strong organic traffic and bring in fantastic user reviews.
					<br>
					<br>
					Finding ways to improve a product with an huge customer base was a challange design-wise. And perhaps more importantly, it was a hands-on lesson in running a SaaS business. Managing design in a living & breathing product in a very agile environment. 

					To me, helping ensure its steady growth was a hands–on lesson in running a SaaS business. In addition to seeing my design decisions affect thousands of customers, I learned a lot about managing a living &amp; breathing product in a very agile environment.
