					<a href="http://local-life.com">Local Life</a> is a franchise network of tourist information websites run by locals. I was brought on to redesign the site and kickstart consolidation of over 30 separate websites under a single Local Life brand.
					<br><br>
					To bring franchisees on board, the design had to be fresh and familiar at the same time, and extra attention had to be given to SEO.

				<p>
					The most important page was the business details page — so that's where I started. The rest of the design decisions flowed from what we&nbsp;learned by showing this page to users and business owners.

					Keeping customizable CSS files separate allowed us to cache 99% of external assets.
				Every city has a unique vibe – and a distinctive color. Using photo backgrounds allowed each city page to bring familiar images to mind.
				<br><br>
					With stencil grafittis and strong offline presence in selected cities, Local Life branding was already recognizable. After many iterations, we decided to stick to a similar style and roll out the change in stages.

					The iPhone app also needed a refresh, but we decided to stick to the basics and ultimately, it wasn't developed.

					In order to simplify managing businesses as much as possible, the admin panel for business owners had to be redesigned. Simplicity, modularity and ease of use were key.

					The new redesigned website was a big success among the franchisees, as well as end users. It made sure Local Life was visually modern, easy to use and flexible enough for every franchisee.
