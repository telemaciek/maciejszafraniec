					Local Life is a franchise network of tourist information websites run by locals. I was brought on to redesign the site and kickstart consolidation of over 30 separate websites under a single Local Life brand.
					<br><br>
					To bring franchisees on board, the design had to be fresh and familiar at the same time, and extra attention had to be given to SEO.

					Every city has a unique vibe – and a distinctive color. Using photo backgrounds allowed each city page to bring familiar images to mind, while maintaining the distinctive look of the brand.
					<!-- Keeping customizable CSS files separate allowed us to cache 99% of external assets. -->
					<br><br>
					The most important page, both for users and businesses, was the page with details of a specific spot. That's why it had to be designed and&nbsp;iterated on first. The rest of the design decisions flowed from what we&nbsp;learned here.

					With stencil grafittis and strong offline presence in selected cities, Local Life branding was already recognizable. After many iterations, we decided to stick to a similar style and roll out the change in stages.

					Our iPhone app also needed a refresh, but we decided to stick to the basics and only include the most important options.

					Admin panel for business customers was also due to be redesigned. Its users were not as tech savvy, so simplicity and clarity was key.

					The new redesigned website was a big success among the franchisees, as well as end users. It made sure Local Life was visually modern, easy to use and flexible enough for every franchisee.
